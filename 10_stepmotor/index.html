  ### Week 10: Step Motors 

  This week's assignment was to use a stepmotor in some way. Firstly, I made the wires for the motor work
  to insure this assignment was doable. It took some time and I had to re-sodder the wires once because
  the origianl step motor wires weren't that good. But after some fixing, here is what it looked like:

  My idea was when I noticed what happened when I moved the motor faster. It looked like one of those spinning
  cases where it slowly rotates around to show an object. After laser cutting some gear pieces and testing
  it out, it worked sort of well:

  Since the gears weren't solid pieces vertically, they would sometimes get stuck together. However, if the
  speed wasn't super fast it tended to work okay.
