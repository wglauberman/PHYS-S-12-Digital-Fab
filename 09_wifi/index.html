  ### Week 9: Wifi and ESP32 

  This week's assignment was very short as we just needed to make something happen with wifi. Since my
  final project will likely include a motor, I decided to use a ESP32 to make a motor spin by connecting
  the wifi scan code and some previous code of mine:

  Here is the code that was used to do this:
  
  '''const int A1A = 26; 
const int A1B = 27;

#include "WiFi.h"

void setup() {

  Serial.begin(115200);

  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFi.disconnect();
  delay(100);

  Serial.println("Setup done");

    
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT); 
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT); 
  Serial.begin(9600); 
  analogWrite(A1A, 0); 
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW); 
  }

void loop() {  
   analogWrite(A1A, 100); 
   digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH); 
   delay(5000);
      }'''
