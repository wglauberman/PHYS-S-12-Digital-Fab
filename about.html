  ### About Me

  Hi, my name is Will Glauberman and I am a rising junior in high school. I am currently here at Harvard Summer program taking
  Intro to Digital Fabrication and Intro to Proofs. My favorite school subjects are math and science, and I play tennis as well.
  I'm taking this class because I want to get better at designing things (and now also running a web page), and it seems like
  these next few weeks will be full of fun!
