  ### Week 6: Sensors 

  For my example sensor, I decided to use the temperature sensor and information because I felt temperature was easiest
  for me to understand in the real world. I used some code from the links on the temperature page of our classwork, and
  created this setup, graph, and proof of concept video:

  The graph is shown in degress fahrenheit because it made sense in my head. I can control the graph by placing the sensor
  on colder or hotter things. The ice lowered the temp to about 70F (21C) from the room 75F(24C), and my hand warmth raised
  it to 100F(38C) when I really pressed on the sensor.
  
  For my personal sensor, I was inspired by my button idea with an arduino to turn on a motor. This time, I decided to use
  copper wires to turn on and off my motor. In the end, I got the copper pieces touching to turn off the motor (without
  short circuiting the whole thing), and have a graph between 0 and 1023 where 1023 is motor on and 0 is off:

  Here is the arduino code for the copper motor project:
  
  const int A1A = 3; 
const int A1B = 4;
int sensorPin = A0;
int sensorValue = 0;
int buttonState = 0;

void setup() { 
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT); 
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT); 
  Serial.begin(9600);
  analogWrite(A1A, 0); digitalWrite(A1B, LOW); 
  }

void loop() {
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); 
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  if (sensorValue > 0) { 
    analogWrite(A1A, 100); 
    digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH); 
    } else { analogWrite(A1A, 0); digitalWrite(A1B, LOW); 
    } 
 }
