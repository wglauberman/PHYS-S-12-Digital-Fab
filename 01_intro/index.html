  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  After our first day of class on Tuesday, I thought about some possible ideas for a final project. 
  Seeing others' ideas definitely helped me think of my own original idea(s). I immediately thought of something to do with sports robots.
  What if a robot could be really good at a sport? My main idea was:
  
  Golfing robot (example, credit: 111215065431-robot-golfer2-story-tablet.jpg)

  Same story for the golf robot, but I'm thinking doing putting instead of driving since driving is up to 200 yards sometimes and that's not
  practical, whereas putting can be in a small area and all you need is a target. The puttbot would possibly use an arduino that has
  certain speeds and would use a motor to hit the golf ball, maybe even into some grassy turf and a hole. Another piece of this could be a
  player option, where you use a button to move the motor back and hit the ball yourself, maybe even a competition between you and computer.
  
  Materials might include wood/3d print for the "putter", a motor to move everything, arduino and breadboard for the coding plus wires,
  buttons, etc. The putter piece might be actually putter shaped, or use a spring to hit the ball.
  
  Here are some sketches representing the image I saw and ideas in my head for prototypes:

  I think my first prototype that I would make would just have a motor and two or three wooden pieces where the motor does a rotation, and my goal
  would be for it to hit the golf ball at a decent speed. My other prototype idea is a spring loaded contraption which hits the golf ball
  and then it goes out far. This would require a spring and maybe laser cut pieces to hold spring in place. 3D printed pieces may or may not be
  used for the putter in the end as well.
  
  Possible timeline:
  
  Week of 7/11: Start arduino code and designing for prototype
  Week of 7/18: Finish draft code and make real life prototype
  Week of 7/25: Tweak arduino if necessary and design final design
  Week of 8/1: Make real final product and check if all is working completely
