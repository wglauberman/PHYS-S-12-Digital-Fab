  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  After our first day of class on Tuesday, I thought about some possible ideas for a final project. 
  Seeing others' ideas definitely helped me think of my own original idea(s). I immediately thought of something to do with sports robots.
  What if a robot could be really good at a sport? Some ideas I have for this are:
  
  Basketball throwing robot (example shown here)

  My idea would be that the robot would have some kind of "arm", and based on the location of the hoop relative to where the robot is,
  I could know the x, y, and z coordinates relatively as well. Then, based on how far away it is the robot would throw at a certain
  angle and certain speed that would hopefully mostly be accurate at making the shot.
  
  Golfing robot as well (example)

  Same story for the golf robot, but I'm thinking putting more than driving since driving is up to 200 yards sometimes and that's not
  practical, whereas putting can be in a small area and all you need is a target. The puttbot would find how far away the head of the
  putter is from the hole/target (only x and y coordinated necessary), and use a certain angle and speed to make the shot as well.
  
  Here are some sketches representing the images I saw and ideas in my head:

  ### Week 1: Fusion 360
  
  Even though I had used Fusion 360 before, I realized I needed a little bit of practice on how to use it. From the tutorital video I
  watched, I learned lots of things, like how to draw sketch shapes, change measurements, and edit 3D sculptures. Here is a sketch I
  made based on the video with lines and arches:

  I also made a "pulley" by sketching two circles, adding connecting lines, and trimming the excess lines from the circle:

  After the tutorial, I felt I was ready to start the assembly project. I decided to model a pen and a notecard page, and I starting by
  roughly measuring the dimensions of the pen and paper (pen was about 5mm radius circle with a height of 70mm, and the notecard was
  about 55 by 65mm). First was the cylinder base for the pen:

  Then, I added the "eraser" and the tip part of the pen, as well as the clicky handle to push the pen tip in and out:

  Next, I made a box notecard and extruded some lines like how there is on a piece of paper:

  Finally, I made it look like the pen was writing on the paper:
