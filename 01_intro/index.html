  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  After our first day of class on Tuesday, I thought about some possible ideas for a final project. 
  Seeing others' ideas definitely helped me think of my own original idea(s). I immediately thought of something to do with sports robots.
  What if a robot could be really good at a sport? Some ideas I have for this are:
  
  Basketball throwing robot (example shown here)

  My idea would be that the robot would have some kind of "arm", and based on the location of the hoop relative to where the robot is,
  I could know the x, y, and z coordinates relatively as well. Then, based on how far away it is the robot would throw at a certain
  angle and certain speed that would hopefully mostly be accurate at making the shot.
  
  Golfing robot as well (example)

  Same story for the golf robot, but I'm thinking putting more than driving since driving is up to 200 yards sometimes and that's not
  practical, whereas putting can be in a small area and all you need is a target. The puttbot would find how far away the head of the
  putter is from the hole/target (only x and y coordinated necessary), and use a certain angle and speed to make the shot as well.

  And here is a	[link](../index.html).
