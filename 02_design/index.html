  ### Week 2: Motor Design 
  
  After laser cutting and re-learning Fusion 360, the next task was to involve a motor in something that moves. My idea was
  to use a motor and a gear to make it appear like an object was moving along a circle. First, I found this wood box roughly
  measuing 30mm by 10mm:

  Then, I quickly modeled the rings of the course and downloaded a gear on a Fusion 360 add in. Here is one of the rings:

  After retrieving a motor and laser-cutting the pieces, this is what it looked like before being put together:

  To put it all together, I drilled a hole to put a wooden rod in the brick piece. In the smaller, noncentered hole of the
  gear in the previous image, I stuck it there and hot glued it into place. I then hot glued the bigger and smaller rings
  to the face of the gear to resemble a "track". Finally, I hot glued the motor into the center hole, and in the end, it
  ended up looking like this:

  The current motor I was using was too small, so I replace it with a motor that fit perfectly in the gear hole spot. To
  make the "machine" stand on its own without my help. I laser cut a box with holes on the top and side so that the
  motor and wires could fit in:

  After all that, here is a video showcasing the movement of my block on a track:

  ### Week 2: Arduino and Motors
  
  I wanted to implement my previous project into this new project, so I connected an arduino to a motor driver to my motor
  and made it spin at various speeds. My drawing of the circuit looks like this

  Here is the setup in the real world:

  and here it is in action:

  I have also pasted the Arduino code here. Basically what it is doing is starting off slow in one direction, gradually
  picking up pace, and stopping after ~12 seconds. Then it would do the same thing in reverse. The reason I had it pick
  up speed is because my block is supposed to be "running around the track" and so I'm trying to make it seem like it
  starts out lightly jogging, and moves into full on running.
  
  void setup() {
  pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT); 
  pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
  analogWrite(A1A, 0); 
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
}

void loop() {

  analogWrite(A1A, 100);
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
  delay(4000); 

  analogWrite(A1A, 150);
  delay(4000);  

  analogWrite(A1A, 200);
  delay(4000); 

  analogWrite(A1A, 0); 
  delay(2500);   

  digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH); 
  analogWrite(A1A, 255-100); 
  delay(4000);              

  analogWrite(A1A, 255-150); 
  delay(4000);

  analogWrite(A1A, 255-200);
  delay(4000);

  analogWrite(A1A, 0);
  digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
  delay(2500);

}
