  ### Week 2: Design Learning 
  
  After laser cutting and re-learning Fusion 360, the next task was to involve a motor in something that moves. My idea was
  to use a motor and a gear to make it appear like an object was moving along a circle. First, I found this wood box roughly
  measuing 30mm by 10mm:

  Then, I quickly modeled the rings of the course and downloaded a gear on a Fusion 360 add in. Here is one of the rings:

  After retrieving a motor and laser-cutting the pieces, this is what it looked like before being put together:

  To put it all together, I drilled a hole to put a wooden rod in the brick piece. In the smaller, noncentered hole of the
  gear in the previous image, I stuck it there and hot glued it into place. I then hot glued the bigger and smaller rings
  to the face of the gear to resemble a "track. Finally, I hot glued the motor into the center hole, and in the end, it
  ended up looking like this:

  At the moment, I have realized I hot glued the top of the motor spinner, which does nothing. I will need to go back and
  fix it so I glue the motor to the inner edge of the gear, that way it will spin.
