  ### Week 2: Laser Cutting and Fusion 360
  
  My first design task was to laser-cut some press fit shapes (shapes that have cuts so that they can combine with other pieces). First,
  in class we learned how to make square press-fits, so I made a "3D" effect by putting six of them together like this:

  Next, because that was easy with perfect symmetry, I tried with a pentagon. The process was roughly the same, making incisions and
  rounding off the edges, but the shape looked a lot cooler:

  Even though I had used Fusion 360 before, I realized I needed a little bit of practice on how to use it. From the tutorital video I
  watched, I learned lots of things, like how to draw sketch shapes, change measurements, and edit 3D sculptures. Here is a sketch I
  made based on the video with lines and arches:

  I also made a "pulley" by sketching two circles, adding connecting lines, and trimming the excess lines from the circle:

  After the tutorial, I felt I was ready to start the assembly project. I decided to model a pen and a notecard page, and I starting by
  roughly measuring the dimensions of the pen and paper (pen was about 5mm radius circle with a height of 70mm, and the notecard was
  about 55 by 65mm). First was the cylinder base for the pen:

  Then, I added the "eraser" and the tip part of the pen, as well as the clicky handle to push the pen tip in and out:

  Next, I made a box notecard and extruded some lines like how there is on a piece of paper:

  Finally, I made it look like the pen was writing on the paper:
