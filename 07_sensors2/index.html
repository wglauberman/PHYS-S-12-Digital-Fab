  ### Week 7: More Sensors 

  For this week, we were tasked with making an output sensor and analyzing it and eventually using it with
  an input sensor. The output sensor I chose is the buzzer because it makes cool sounds. Here is a
  demonstration of it:

  I think it is a pretty cool thing. I also got some photos of attaching this buzzer to an osciloscope:

  Based on voltages and time measurements, you can change how wide the x axis x (horizontal distortion) and
  the y axis (vertical distortion). There is about 2.5 beeps every 1 millisecond on the graphs. The note played
  in the first one is C4 (262Hz) and the second was D#4/Eb4 (312Hz).
  
  To combine an input sensor and an output sensor, I decided to use the copper stickers again since they were
  easy to work with. I got it so when you pressed them together the song wouldn't play, but when they were
  separated the song would play again:

  This was just done with combining the "note code" from the doom song and my copper code from last time.
  
  The final thing was to make a simple 2.5d file for next class, so I made this block with different shape
  cutouts like those kids games:
