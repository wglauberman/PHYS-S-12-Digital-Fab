  ### Week 5: 3D Printing / Photogrammetry 

  For my 3D print, we wanted something that wasn't easily made by laser cutting. I thought the best way of that being
  possible was if I found something with lots of little extruded pieces. I picked this ship, and here are the stl and
  gcode files:
  
  <a download href='1_2400_Merchant.stl'>Download my STL file <\a>
    
  <a download href='merchantship.gcode'>Download my GCODE file <\a>
    
  It turned out really good in the 3D printer after just a 15 minute print. One interesting thing I noticed was it had
  some filling in between the ship wings that looked like support structures but was just a result of how I made the
  settings for the 3D printer:

  For the photogrammetry, I took a stick-to-the-wall hanger and with the app Metascan, I took about 25 photos to produce
  this photogrammetry 3D model, I think it turned out very well:
