  ### Week 8: Casting and Molding 

  This week's assignment was to make and mold some things. For the design part, I decided to go with
  shopbot instead of the 3d bot because this seemed more understandable to me. I designed a person
  thing in fusion and cut him out (outer layer was full cuts, eyes and mouth were pocket cuts):

  Next was the mold/cast part. I decided to 3d print this uno card from thingiverse (credit to

  Then, with some pieces to hold it in place, I molded it around a silicon mixture for over a day:

  After a day, it had solidified and I had a place to cast some wax mixture of Part A and Part B:
